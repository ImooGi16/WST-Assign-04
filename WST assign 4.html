		<h1>Web Systems and Technologies <br> Assignment 04</h1>
        <p>HTML is the most basic of the three languages and is relatively easy to learn. Its syntax is simple and straightforward, and it primarily focuses on the structure and content of a webpage. Even non-programmers can easily grasp the basics of HTML.</p>
        <p>CSS, on the other hand, is a bit more complex than HTML. It focuses on the visual aspects of a webpage, such as layout, color, and typography. While CSS can be challenging to learn, once you understand its syntax and concepts, it becomes a powerful tool for designing beautiful and responsive websites.</p>
        <p>JavaScript is the most complex of the three languages, as it is a full-fledged programming language that allows developers to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It requires a deeper understanding of programming concepts such as variables, functions, and loops. While it can be challenging to learn, JavaScript is essential for creating dynamic and interactive web applications.</p>
        <p>In summary, HTML is the easiest to learn, CSS is more complex but still manageable, and JavaScript is the most challenging but also the most powerful of the three languages. However, each language plays a vital role in web development, and mastering all three is necessary to create engaging and functional websites.</p>
